You are an expert at solving puzzles.\n\nFind the common pattern that transforms each input grid into its corresponding output grid, based on\nthe training examples below.\n\nYour task is to write clear instructions that describe this transformation pattern. These instructions must:\n- Apply consistently to ALL training examples (the same rule works for every inputâ†’output pair)\n- Be general enough to work on new test cases\n- Be intuitive and easy to understand\n- Describe the pattern without referencing specific example numbers or positions\n\nThe transformation pattern should be simple and logical - these puzzles are designed to have elegant,\nintuitive solutions that humans can readily grasp.\n\nWrite your instructions as a clear, step-by-step process that someone could follow to transform any\ninput grid into the correct output grid.\n\nHere are the training examples and test input grids:\n--Training Examples--\n\nTraining Example 1\nInput:\n6 6 0\n6 0 0\n0 6 6\nOutput:\n6 6 0 6 6 0 0 0 0\n6 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 6 6 0 0

have attempted to describe the transformation pattern for these grids.\nEach attempt captured some aspects correctly but failed in other ways.\n\nBelow you'll find:\n- Each set of proposed instructions\n- The outputs produced when following those instructions\n- How those outputs differ from the correct answers\n\nYour task is to analyze why each approach partially failed and synthesize a complete, correct set of\ninstructions.\n\nBy examining multiple flawed attempts, you can:\n- Identify what each approach got right\n- Understand what each approach missed\n- Recognize common misconceptions about the pattern\n- Build comprehensive instructions that avoid all these pitfalls\n\nStudy the patterns of success and failure across all attempts, then write instructions that correctly\ndescribe the complete transformation rule that works for ALL training examples.\n\nYour final instructions should be clear, intuitive, and capture the true underlying pattern.\n\n<instructions_1>\n### Rule Summary\nThe transformation rule is to repeat each row and column of the input grid three times to create a 9x9 output grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Procedure\n1. **Identify Input Grid Dimensions**: Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.\n2. **Create Output Grid**: Initialize an empty 9x9 grid.\n3. **Repeat Rows**: For each row in the input grid, repeat it three times to fill three rows in the output grid.\n4. **Repeat Columns**: For each column in the input grid, repeat it three times to fill three columns in the output grid.\n\n### Notes for Edge-Cases/Ambiguities\n- If the input grid has dimensions other than 3x3, adjust the tiling factor accordingly (e.g., if H_in = W_in = n, then H_out = W_out = 3n).\n- Ensure that the row and column alternation patterns are preserved in the output grid.\n</instructions_1>\n<scores_from_instructions_1>\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 1 56% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 2 56% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 3 56% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 4 56% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 5 56% correct with these instructions.\n</scores_from_instructions_1>\n\n<instructions_2>\n**Rule Summary:** The output grid is a 9x9 tiling of the input grid, preserving the original pattern and values.\n\n**Transformation Procedure:**\n1. **Identify Input Grid Dimensions:** Determine the height (H_in) and width (W_in) of the input grid.\n2. **Calculate Output Grid Dimensions:** Compute the height (H_out) and width (W_out) of the output grid using the formula H_out = 3 * H_in and W_out = 3 * W_in.\n3. **Tile Input to Output:** For each cell in the input grid, replicate its value into a 3x3 block in the corresponding position in the output grid.\n\n**Edge Cases/Notes:**\n- The tiling preserves the original pattern and values of the input grid.\n- If the input grid has varying patterns or colors, they are repeated in a 3x3 block in the output grid.\n</instructions_2>\n<scores_from_instructions_2>\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 1 54% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 2 54% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 3 54% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 4 54% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 5 54% correct with these instructions.\n</scores_from_instructions_2>\n\n<instructions_3>\n**Rule Summary:**\nThe output grid is a 9x9 tiling of the input grid, preserving the row/column alternation patterns.\n\n**Transformation Procedure:**\n1. **Identify Input Grid Dimensions:** Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.\n2. **Calculate Output Grid Dimensions:** The output grid will have dimensions H_out = 3 * H_in and W_out = 3 * W_in.\n3. **Tile the Input Grid:** Repeat each row and column of the input grid three times to form the output grid, ensuring that the alternating patterns are preserved.\n\n**Edge-Cases/Notes:**\n- If the input grid has a height or width of 1, the output will be a 9x9 grid with the same color pattern repeated.\n- The transformation always results in a 9x9 grid regardless of the input size as long as it is at least 3x3.\n</instructions_3>\n<scores_from_instructions_3>\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 1 44% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 2 44% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 3 44% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 4 44% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 5 44% correct with these instructions.\n</scores_from_instructions_3>\n\n<instructions_4>\n### Rule Summary\nThe transformation rule is to repeat each row and column of the input grid three times to create a 9x9 output grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Procedure\n1. **Identify Input Grid**: Start with an input grid of size H x W.\n2. **Create Output Grid**: Create a new grid of size 3H x 3W.\n3. **Copy Rows**: For each row in the input grid, copy it three times into corresponding rows in the output grid.\n4. **Copy Columns**: For each column in the input grid, copy it three times into corresponding columns in the output grid.\n\n### Edge-Cases/Ambiguities\n- If the input grid has any specific patterns or symmetries that should be preserved, ensure they are maintained during the tiling process.\n- Ensure that the row and column alternation patterns visible in the outputs are not grouped by value but rather repeated individually.\n</instructions_4>\n<scores_from_instructions_4>\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 1 29% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 2 29% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 3 29% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 4 29% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 5 29% correct with these instructions.\n</scores_from_instructions_4>\n\n<instructions_5>\n**Rule Summary:**\nThe transformation rule involves tiling the input grid by repeating it in both rows and columns, resulting in a 9x9 output grid.\n\n**Step-by-Step Procedure to Transform ANY New Input:**\n\n1. **Identify the Input Grid Size:** Determine the height (H) and width (W) of the input grid.\n2. **Calculate Tiling Factor:** The tiling factor is always 3, meaning each row and column of the input grid will be repeated three times in the output grid.\n3. **Tile Rows:** For each row in the input grid, repeat it three times to form a new row in the output grid.\n4. **Tile Columns:** Repeat the entire set of rows (which now form a 9xW grid) three times to create the final 9x9 output grid.\n\n**Notes for Edge-Cases/Ambiguities:**\n- If the input grid size is not exactly 3x3, the rule still applies. The tiling factor remains 3, and each row/column will be repeated accordingly.\n- Ensure that the repetition preserves the alternating patterns visible in the outputs, avoiding grouping entire blocks by value.\n</instructions_5>\n<scores_from_instructions_5>\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 1 17% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 2 17% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 3 17% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 4 17% correct with these instructions.\nThe human got the grid for Training Example 5 17% correct with these instructions.\n</scores_from_instructions_5>\n\nAssistant:\nSynthesize new instructions that:\n- Fix the specific errors shown across attempts\n- Still work correctly for ALL training examples\n- Remain clear, intuitive, and general\n\nReturn ONLY:\n1) A one-sentence rule summary.\n2) A numbered, step-by-step procedure for transforming ANY new input for this task.\n3) Brief notes for edge-cases/ambiguities.\n",
